# Module 1 - Lab 1 - Exercise 1 - Deploy Microsoft Defender for Endpoint

## Lab scenario

You are a Security Operations Analyst working at a company that is implementing Microsoft Defender for Endpoint. Your manager plans to onboard a few devices to provide insight into required changes to the SecOps team response procedures.

You start by initializing the Defender for Endpoint environmentâ€”next, you onboard the initial devices for your deployment by running the onboarding script on the devices. You configure security for the environment. Next, you create Device groups and assign the appropriate devices.

### Task 1 - Obtain Your Microsoft 365 Credentials

Once you launch the lab, a free trial tenant will be made available to you to access in the Microsoft Virtual Lab environment. This tenant will be automatically assigned a unique username and password. You must retrieve this username and password so that you can sign in to Azure and Microsoft 365 within the Microsoft Virtual Lab environment. 

1. Because this course can be offered by learning partners using any one of several authorized lab hosting providers, the actual steps involved to retrieve tenant ID associated with your tenant may vary by lab hosting provider. Therefore, your instructor will provide you with the necessary instructions on how to retrieve this information for your course. The information that you should note for later use includes:

	- **Tenant suffix ID.** This ID is for the onmicrosoft.com accounts that you will use to sign in to Microsoft 365 throughout the labs. This is in the format of **{username}@M365xZZZZZZ.onmicrosoft.com**, where ZZZZZZ is your unique tenant suffix ID provided by your lab hosting provider. Record this ZZZZZZ value for later use. When any of the lab steps direct you to sign in to Microsoft 365 portals, you must enter the ZZZZZZ value that you obtained here.
	- **Tenant password.** This is the password for the admin account provided by your lab hosting provider.
