### Task 5: Onboard Microsoft Defender for Endpoint Device.

In this task, you will on-board a device to Microsoft Defender for Endpoint.

>**IMPORTANT:** If you completed the labs in the first module of this course AND saved your Virtual Machines you have already performed this task. This means that if youâ€™re using the same virtual machine from that lab exercise you can skip this task.

1. Login to WIN1 virtual machine as Admin with the password: **Pa55w.rd**.  

2. In the Edge browser, go to the Microsoft 365 Defender portal at (https://security.microsoft.com) and login with the **Tenant Email** credentials if you are not currently in the portal.
