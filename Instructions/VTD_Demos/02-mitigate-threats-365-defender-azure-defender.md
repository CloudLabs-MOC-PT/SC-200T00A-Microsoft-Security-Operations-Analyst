# Module 2 - Mitigate threats using Azure Defender

## Lab scenario

You're a Security Operations Analyst working at a company that implemented Azure Defender. You need to respond to security alerts generated by Azure Defender.

### Mitigate security alerts

In this task, you will load sample security alerts and review the alert details.

1. Go the  **Azure Security Center** > **Security Alerts** screen. If the sample alerts were created as directed in the [pre-requisites section](00-prerequisites.md#Deploy-sample-alerts-for-Demo-in-Module-2), there should be multiple security alerts on this screen.

9. For several of the alerts listed, perform the following actions:

    A. Select the alert, information about the alert should appear in a pane on the right.  Click **View full details**.

    B. Review the Alert details.

    C. Select the **Take action** tab.

    D. Review the Take action information. Notice the buttons available to take action depend on the type of alert.

## You have completed the lab.
